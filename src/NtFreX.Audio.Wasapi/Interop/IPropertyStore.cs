    /// An implementation of this interface is provided by CLSID_InMemoryPropertyStore, as IPropertyStoreCache.Users should never need to implement it themselves.
    /// CLSID_InMemoryPropertyStore implements IPropertyStoreCache instead of IPropertyStore so that it can store additional state information (PSC_STATE) about 
    /// each of the properties in the cache.This information can be useful for property handler implementers.It can also be useful in other 
    /// scenarios where a cache of property values is needed.
    /// 
    /// Requirements:
    ///  Minimum supported client
    ///  - Windows Vista [desktop apps | Windows Store apps]
    /// 
    ///  Minimum supported server
    ///  - Windows Server 2008 [desktop apps | Windows Store apps]
